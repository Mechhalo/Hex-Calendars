A repo of hex calendars that was inspired by https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/a30ncw/one_root_to_rule_them_all_linux_hex_calendar_for/
which was created by reddit user *u/denholmsdead*.
His repo is located at https://gitlab.com/jstpcs/lnxpcs/blob/master/calendars/2019/calendar-2019-root.png

2019 calendars have been both updated from *u/denholmsdead*'s 2018, along with new designs
